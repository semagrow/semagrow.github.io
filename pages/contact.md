During 2012-2015 Semagrow development was partially funded by
the *Seventh Framework Programme* of the European Commision
under [Grant Agreement 318497][2], the [SemaGrow project][1].
Please see the SemaGrow site for more information about the project
and its various outcomes besides the query federation endpoint
described here.

During 2015-2017 Semagrow will be piloted, maintained, and hardened in
the context of the [Big Data Europe][3] action. Big Data Europe
received funding from the Horizon 2020 research and innovation
programme of the European Commision under
[Grant Agreement 644564][4].

The [Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications][5]
of [NCSR "Demokritos"][6], Athens, Greece and the
[Semantic Web Company][7], Vienna, Austria were involved in both
projects and have also contributed own resources to the
development of Semagrow.
