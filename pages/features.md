## Data integration made easy

blah


## Advanced query execution planning

The Semagrow query planner exploits metadata about the nodes of the
federation to optimize query execution. This metadata follows our
[Sevod vocabulary][1]. Sevod extends the [VoID vocabulary][2] with
statistical information akin to database histograms.




## Non-blocking query execution

The multi-threaded execution engine of the Semagrow Stack is developed
following the reactive paradigm, operating asynchronously and
non-blocking in the face of unresponsive or slow data producers.
