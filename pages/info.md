During 2012-2015 Semagrow development was partially funded by
the *Seventh Framework Programme* of the European Commision
under [Grant Agreement 318497][2].
Please see the [SemaGrow project site][1] for more information about
the project and its various outcomes besides the query federation
endpoint described in this Web site.

During 2015-2017 the Semagrow query processor will be piloted,
maintained, and hardened in the context of the [Big Data Europe][3]
action. Big Data Europe receives funding from the Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme of the European Commision under
[Grant Agreement 644564][4].
