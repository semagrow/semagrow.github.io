Angelos Charalambidis and myself represented Semagrow at the
[Federated Querying Workshop][1] organized by [iMinds][3] in Gent on
November 13th. The workshop brought together several researchers
working on federated querying, aiming to coalesce them into a
community. Towards this end, workshop participants decided to initiate
the [RDF Query Processing][2] discussion forum and to try to establish
a regular series of workshops.

A major topic discussed on that day was benchmarking and
[FedBench][4]: despite the catalytic role that the latter has played
in federated querying research, the seems to be consensus that a new
benchmark is needed.

Another topic was issues associated with federating data sources that
support extensions of the core SPARQL specification, such as the
spatio-temporal geoSPARQL and stSPARQL extensions. And, more
ambitiously, how to federate data stores that support a different, but
apparently compatible, syntax such as Cassandra CQL.
